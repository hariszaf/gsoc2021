  task: Get the models 
  summary: Metabolic network reconstruction is a far from easy task. In case of bacteria, semi-automated ways make things a bit easier, for example <a href="https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"><em>carveme</em></a> is a software tool that takes a genome as input to build its corresponding metabolic model.<br> However, the GTDB genomes described in the proposal were thoroughly investigated but since they only include a short number of genes and not the complete genome, they were not used for this project. Instead, I used the <a href="https://github.com/cdanielmachado/embl_gems">EMBL genome scale models</a> after I built a script for converting them from <em>.xml</em> to <em>.mat</em> format. A series of 5,587 models are now available and can be used in the <em>darn</em> framework. <br> In addition, genomes from <a href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/">JGI/IMG</a> were retrieved and metabolic models were built based on them, using the <em>carveme</em> software. As <em>carveme</em> needs the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer">IBM CPLEX Optimizer</a> as a dependency, I used the academic edition of it. <em>carveme</em> returns <em>.xml</em> models, so the script for converting the model format was used again. More and more genomes will be added in the ongoing <em>darn</em> database using genomes from global repositories, such as JGI/IMG.
