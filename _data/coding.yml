  task: Get the models 
  summary: Metabolic network reconstruction is a far from easy task. In case of bacteria, semi-automated ways make things a bit easier, for example <a href="https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"><em>carveme</em></a> is a software tool that takes a genome as input to build its corresponding metabolic model. <br> 
  The GTDB genomes described in the proposal were thoroughly investigated, however as they only include a short number of genes and not the complete genome, I used the <a href="https://github.com/cdanielmachado/embl_gems">EMBL genome scale models<\a> by building a script for converting them from <em>.xml<\em> to <em>.mat<\em> format. <br>
    <em>carveme<\em> needs the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer">IBM CPLEX Optimizer</a>. As CPLEX academic license

  Full features but limited to 1000 variables and 1000 constraints 
   as they included only a number of genes, already built models were prefered. In addition, installing CPLEX
