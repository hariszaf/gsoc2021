  task: The challenges
  summary: This project has great challenges both from the computational and the biological point-of-view. To this end, studying about <em>how</em> someone could address the challenge of extracting inter-species metabolic processes out of genome-scale metabolic reconstuctions of the species present in a microbial community, will be essential. Here are some of the relative scientific papers. <br> It was a fortunate coincidence that just before this GSoC project started, a great review by Heinken et al. (2021) was published, describing both the framework of our work and the challenges, to a great extent.
