  task: Get the models 
  summary: Metabolic network reconstruction is a far from easy task. In case of bacteria, semi-automated ways make things a bit easier, for example <a href="https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"><em>carveme</em></a> is a software tool that takes a genome as input to build its corresponding metabolic model.<br> However, the GTDB genomes described in the proposal were thoroughly investigated but since they only include a short number of genes and not the complete genome, they were not used for this project. Instead, I used the <a href="https://github.com/cdanielmachado/embl_gems">EMBL genome scale models</a> after I built a script for converting them from <em>.xml</em> to <em>.mat</em> format. A series of 5,587 models are now available and can be used in the <em>darn</em> framework. <br> In addition, genomes from <a href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/">JGI/IMG</a> were retrieved and metabolic models were built based on them, using the <em>carveme</em> software. As <em>carveme</em> needs the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer">IBM CPLEX Optimizer</a> as a dependency, I used the academic edition of it. <em>carveme</em> returns <em>.xml</em> models, so the script for converting the model format was used again. More and more genomes will be added in the ongoing <em>darn</em> database using genomes from global repositories, such as JGI/IMG. During this period, I built a Google Colab notebook as a tutorial for the <em>dingo</em> library which was also presented in the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC). My presentation there will soon be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXZ6jV_cld3Hp-C_0m4aCznk">BOSC YouTube channel</a> too. You may find the notebook under <a href"https://github.com/GeomScale/dingo/pull/17">PR \#17</a>.

  task: How to validate our future outcome?
  summary: As described in the proposal, the step of finding a way to validate the outcome of this new <em>dingo</em> module I have described, is probably the hardest one. The SMETANA software that was initially meant to be used for this task, did not fit for this task. Several ongoing approaches aim to address this challenge, such as the recently published `Metage2Metabo` software tool (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61968">publication</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AuReMe/metage2metabo">GitHub repo</a>). I will use this software in the near future to compare its findings with those that the <em>dingo</em> module I am working at will return.
