  summary: This project has great challenges both from the computational and the biological point-of-view. To this end, studying about <em>how</em> someone could address the challenge of extracting inter-species metabolic processes out of genome-scale metabolic reconstuctions of the species present in a microbial community, will be essential. Here are some of the relative scientific papers. <br> It was a fortunate coincidence that just before this GSoC project started, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.007"> a great review by Heinken et al. (2021) </a> was published, describing both the framework of our work and the challenges, to a great extent. Here is some extra related literature.

  uni: Setting up our working framework
  summary: A GitHub repository has already been initiated for this project. The proposal can be found there as well as the source code of this GitHub pages blog. In addition, a fork of the main <i>dingo</i> GitHub repository was built. PRs will be implemented from this fork to the main <i>dingo</i> repository.

  uni: Conclusions after the bonding period
  summary: My interaction with microbiologists highlighted the challenges of the project. The scientific literature retrieved represents that there are strong ongoing efforts that try to address the question of interspecies metabolic interactions inference. 
  approach: After the bonding period I have now a specific plan for this project. My framework will be to model a microbial community using the assumptions that <em>micom</em> does and instead of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) implement the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling algorith of <em>dingo</em>. This way, the
