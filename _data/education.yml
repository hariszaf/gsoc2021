  summary: This project has great challenges both from the computational and the biological point-of-view. To this end, studying about <em>how</em> someone could address the challenge of extracting inter-species metabolic processes out of genome-scale metabolic reconstuctions of the species present in a microbial community, will be essential. Here are some of the relative scientific papers.
