# what follows after GSoC
- task: This GSoC project has been a great opportunity for me to work on the <em>dingo<\em> library focusing on the metabolic interactions inference at the microbial community level. This project is now ongoing and it will be further deployed in the next months as part of my PhD. A publication of <em>dingo<\em> and applications of it on metabolic interactions inference will also be considered.
